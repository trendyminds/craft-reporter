### Added
- Process reports via the CLI using `php craft reporter/report --handle=myReport`

### Updated
- Use `$hasCpSection` to insert Reporter navigation link in the control panel. This ensures it's ordered properly in the sidebar by Craft.
- Use Craft's baked-in permissions when using `$hasCpSection` instead of custom one.
